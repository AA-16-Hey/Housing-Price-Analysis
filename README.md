# Housing-Price-Analysis
This project analyzes the pricing trends on the real estate market and its influencing factors.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project examines trends in housing prices in the real estate sector by analyzing a dataset containing variables like property size (area), number of bedrooms, bathrooms and stories and so on. The goal is to assess how these factors impact housing pricing and in the long run, their implications on investment opportunities.

# OBJECTIVES
•	Determine the average values for essential metrics such as price, area, and number of bedrooms.
•	Classify properties into distinct price categories: High, Medium, and Low.
•	Analyze the impact of features such as furnishing, air conditioning, hot-water heating, and basements on housing prices.
•	Develop a well-structured, interactive dashboard to effectively present key insights derived from the analysis.

# METHODOLOGY
•	Data Cleaning: Checked for duplicate entries and blank spaces. Standardized formats and organized data into a table for easier navigation.
•	Segmentation: The data was grouped into different price ranges, categorizing houses into high, medium and low categories.
•	Pivot Tables and Charts: Created pivot tables to summarize the count of houses based on key housing features across the three price ranges.
•	Dashboard: Created charts and slicers to visualize findings and enhance the interactivity of the report.
•	Functions Used: AVERAGE, IF, COUNTIF, Pivot tables, maximum and minimum value of key features, slicers, filters and conditional formatting.

# KEY FINDINGS
•	The average price of houses on the market is ₵4,767,740.19. The average area of a house is 5,264.07 sq. ft. The average number of bedrooms and bathrooms of a house on the market are 3 and 1 respectively. The average number of floors of a house is 2.
•	Low priced houses make up the largest portion of the dataset, totaling 254 out of 378 houses. Medium priced houses account for 114, making the high priced segment the least represented and rarest segment with 7 houses on the market.

•	102(27%) of houses have the basement feature while 276(73%) do not have it.
•	Out of 378 houses, only 17(4.5%) offer the hotwaterheating feature. It is very rare across all the price segments.  	

# DASHBOARDS SUMMARY
The final dashboard includes the following:
•	Summary stats: These highlight the average values of price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms and stories.
•	Segmented bar charts for the number of houses, furnishing status, preferred area, air-condition status, basement status and hotwaterheating features.
•	Interactive slicers for guestrooms, parking, main road, stories, bathrooms and bedrooms.

# Conclusion and recommendation
The data reveals that a high percentage of the houses are in the low priced segment. This means either consumers are showing preference towards more affordable housing options or there is an oversupply of houses in that segment. In contrast, homes equipped with amenities such as air conditioning, basements, or furnishings are more commonly priced in the Medium to High range.
There should be improvements on properties to increase value. Future evaluations would benefit from including location-specific variables to uncover more insights. Potential investors should target medium priced houses and add features like air conditioning to increase the value of the houses.
